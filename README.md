Target Metadata

    The diagnosis consists of a string of letters indicating diagnosed conditions.
    A diagnosis "-" indicates no condition requiring comment.  A diagnosis of the
    form "X|Y" is interpreted as "consistent with X, but more likely Y".  The
    conditions are divided into groups where each group corresponds to a class of
    comments.

    A   hyperthyroid
    B   T3 toxic
    C   toxic goitre
    D   secondary toxic

    hypothyroid conditions:

    E   hypothyroid
    F   primary hypothyroid
    G   compensated hypothyroid
    H   secondary hypothyroid

    binding protein:

    I   increased binding protein
    J   decreased binding protein

    general health:

    K   concurrent non-thyroidal illness
